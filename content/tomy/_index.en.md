I grew up a tech geek at just 10 years old in Taipei, Taiwan 🇹🇼. After writing my first automation scripts in high school before earning my Master’s in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon.

Now based in San Jose, CA 🇺🇸, I’ve worked on cloud infrastructure at WeRide and enjoy diving into self-hosting projects, databases, and improving developer experience.

When I’m not building (or messing around), you’ll find me traveling, exploring new cafes and bookstores, watching movies, or geeking out over the latest gadgets.

I love finely crafted software — like macarons — and side projects that spark joy — like ice cream.

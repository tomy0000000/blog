Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Taipei, Taiwan 🇹🇼, a curious little tech enthusiast emerged at the tender age of 10. Enthralled by the magic of technology, I began weaving my first automation spells during the whimsical days of high school. Thus began my enchanting journey into the realm of software engineering, leading me to the hallowed halls of Carnegie Mellon, where I acquired a Master's degree in Software Engineering. Each line of code was a brushstroke in a grand masterpiece, and my adventures in technology became a delightful tale of creativity and discovery!

Now based in San Jose, CA 🇺🇸, I’ve worked on cloud infrastructure at WeRide and enjoy diving into self-hosting projects, databases, and improving developer experience.

When I’m not building (or messing around), you’ll find me traveling, exploring new cafes and bookstores, watching movies, or geeking out over the latest gadgets.

I love finely crafted software — like macarons — and side projects that spark joy — like ice cream.

There was a moment when I almost opened an online privacy policy generator, but I stumbled a while and thought, why waste time making this crap. So I think it's best to write one in plain English instead.

I have no interest in any individual visiting and reading my blog, which is why I don't collect any "particular" info about anyone.

But I do interested in the whole picture of my audiences, which is why I track visitors with my self-hosted Plausible Analytics instance.

## TL;DR

Data I collected: 

{{< icon "check" >}} Which website leads my visitors here

{{< icon "check" >}} What countries do my visitors come from

{{< icon "check" >}} What device do my visitors use (Phone, Tablet, or Computer)

{{< icon "check" >}} What operating systems do my visitors use (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)

{{< icon "check" >}} What browsers (and versions) do my visitors use (Chrome, Safari, Firefox...)

{{< icon "check" >}} Which pages have more/less visits

Data I did not collect: 

{{< icon "xmark" >}} Data regarding any individual visiting this site (name, phone, email, social accounts...)

## If you still have concerned and want to Opt-out

You can block my tracker with blockers (like uBlock, Adblock Plus, or AdGuard) following [guides from Plausible](https://plausible.io/docs/excluding)

- `yourdomain.com` should be `blog.tomy.me`
- `yourproxy.com` should be `a.tomy.me`

Or a more straightforward approach: don't visit ;-)
